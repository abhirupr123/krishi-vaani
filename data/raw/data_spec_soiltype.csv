DATA SPECIFICATIONS,
Layer Name:,Fraction Area â€“ clayey textured soil (fclayey.asc)
Header file name:,fclayey.hdr
Version:,1
Summary:,"This layer consists of fraction of clayey textured soil within a grid cell of 5000meters x 5000meters. The product was derived using soil and Land Use/Cover maps on 1:250,000 scale generated using multi-temporal AWiFS data aboard Resourcesat-1 / 2. The data is provided as long integer format. To convert the data to fraction area of grid cell, the number has to be divided with 10000."
